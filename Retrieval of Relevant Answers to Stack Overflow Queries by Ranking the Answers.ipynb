It acts as a valuable repository for novice programmers by helping them resolve their queries. As per the Stack Overflow survey 2019, almost 97% of developers visited the Stack Overflow website last year. It also states that each month, about 50 million people visit Stack Overflow to learn, share, and build their careers. Although this forum offers numerous advantages for developers, on the flip side there are few drawbacks associated with it. Due to massive collaboration, there exist different forms of the same questions and each question has more than one answer. Many users find it difficult to get relevant answers to their queries. To overcome these difficulties, we aim to study the semantic similarity between questions, and answer choices available in the Stack Overflow system and analyze the most relevant answers to the question searched using a ranking methodology to produce the most appropriate answer set for the users. \n","\n","We divided this project into three parts, \n","1.\tQuestion Processing\n","2.\tAnswer Processing\n","3.\tQuestion and Answer Relevance Mapping\n","\n","Question Processing : \n","    In this phase, we compare probe questions with stack overflow question corpus to find most similar questions in the corpus. \n","Answer Processing: \n","    In this phase, associated answers for selected questions are filters and grouped together to form various answer clusters. \n","Question and Answer Mapping:\n","    Each answer clusters are compared to search questions using cosine similarity to check relevance between question and answers.
